## Goals
- Create a service where users may check in reasonable time what they may be at risk for
## Challenges
- Acquisition of data (https://github.com/beamandrew/medical-data)
- Cropping user images appropriately so that they interface with NN properly
## Restrictions --optional--
"I want to eat ice-cream if I pass." -- Not if you care about your dental health!
