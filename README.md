Take in public data of human eye scans, and determine whether or not
someone is at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy or other severe
eye issues.

## Goals
- Achieve high accuracy classifying diabetic retinopathy risk
- Beat top 10% of state-of-the-art classifiers using new neural network methods
## Challenges
- Acquisition of data (https://github.com/beamandrew/medical-data)
  - Overcome thanks to Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD)
- Cropping user images appropriately so that they interface with NN properly (often the images are surrounded with black)
## Restrictions --optional--
"I want to eat ice-cream if I pass." -- Not if you care about your eyes!
